# observer

observer is a behavior pattern that focuses on the management of messages past between
objects. However, unlike the mediator pattern which orchestrates communication, the observer
pattern relies on subscriptions. Start at the `main.go` file, and execute the program
in the terminal with

```
go run .
```
