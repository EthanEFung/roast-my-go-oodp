state is a behavioral pattern that focuses on limiting the behavior of an object to a
series of modes and providing means of transisition between them. See `main.go` for
more details. Note that the `main` func executable is a long-lived task. From the terminal
```
go run .

ctrl+c // to interrupt the program
```
