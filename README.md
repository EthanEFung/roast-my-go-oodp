# Roast My Code - Object Oriented Design Patterns - Go

This is a personal project made to fail in public. As primarily a Typescript developer, 
I have a personal goal of writing elegant Go, as well as understanding the Object
Oriented Design Patterns of the famous [Gang of Four book](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8).

What better way to gain experience then to write bad code and ask for feedback.

Having heavy influence by the terrific website
[Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/), I've written a series of example mini
applications that "demonstrate how to implement" the object oriented design patterns
in Go, but they can use some improvements. As I am writing this readme, I don't know
what about these design patterns are _good_, or how they compare to idiomatic
Go patterns. 

To clarify what I'm looking for is constructive feedback. Please abide by this
project's [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and give context and an explanation
of your contribution. What makes a joke great is that it's simultaneously true and
surprising. Same can be said about your contributions to this discussion. The best
code roast is one that has a great argument or point anyone can understand.

# How to help (How to roast)

The easiest way to start is to browse the files of the "Roast of the Week" (one of the
directories in this project), and find a problem that falls into one of the following
categories.

1. Tell me why an example misrepresents the object oriented pattern.
2. Tell me why a pattern over complicates something trivial in Go.
3. Call out the ambiguity of an example.

If you simply have a critique, I would suggest navigating to the issues tab, and
creating a `new issue`. Give me a decent title along side of the your feedback, when I
read the issue, I'll be labelling it.

If you have a code improvement, you could also make a pull request. Fork this
repository, make your change on your forked copy and submit a pull requests via the
pull requests tab.

Bear in mind, the issue or pull request is not limited to the roast of the week. Any
directory in this project is fair game to critique. 

Thanks for your help!
