# Roast My Code - Object Oriented Design Patterns - Go

This is a personal project made to fail in public. As primarily a Typescript developer, 
I have a personal goal of writing elegant Go, as well as understanding the Object Oriented Design Patterns of the
famous [Gang of Four book](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8).

What better way to gain experience then to write bad code and ask for feedback.

Having heavy influence by the terrific website [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/), I've put together a series of examples that "demonstrate how to implement" the object oriented design patterns in Go. However, having wrote them or mimicked the examples that I read about, I don't know what about these design patterns are _good_, or how they compare to idiomatic Go patterns.

# How to be a roast master

To clarify what I'm looking for is constructive feedback. Please abide by this project's [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and give context and an explanation of your contribution. What makes a joke great is that it's simultaneously true and surprising. Same can be said about your contributions to this discussion. The best code roast is one that has a great argument or point anyone can understand.

# Ways to roast
Here's just a few ideas of how to contribute.
1. Tell me why an example misrepresents the object oriented pattern.
2. Tell me why a pattern over complicates something trivial in Go.
3. Call out the ambiguity of an example, and offer suggestions of how to improve the example.
