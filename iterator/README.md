# iterator

iterator is a behavioral pattern that allows users to traverse items in a collection
without having to understand the underlying data structure of the collection. This
derives utility when the data structure has not been fully defined, but the application
needs a way to iterate over collections of different implementations. See the example
in `main.go` and from the terminal run
```
go run .
```
to see the results
