# chain of responsibility

The chain of responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that reduces the
complexity of an application by chaining together a series of functions that are
interchangeable yet executed sequentially. Each handler thus can focus on a single
responsibility and abstracts all other responsibilities away. Visit the `main.go`
file to see the example and in the command line run
```
go run .
```
to see the output of the example.
