# builder

The builder pattern is a creational design pattern helps developer create complex
objects step by step instead of all at once. This has the added benefit, of
allowing greater flexibility when configuring a complex object that has many
different representations of the object. Visit the main file, and execute the code
by running in the terminal 
```
go run .
```
